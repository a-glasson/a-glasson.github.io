        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Alex Glasson, a budding venture capitalist, serial entrepreneur, and a confluence of innovation and strategic foresight. My journey in the corporate world is a testimony to relentless pursuit, visionary leadership, and an unwavering commitment to fostering growth and innovation in the business ecosystem.<br>
		<br>


		I embarked on my academic sojourn at the University of Denver, Daniels College of Business, where I first earned my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, graduating with Cum Laude honors. Driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge, I continued to broaden my horizons, currently pursuing an MBA and an MS in Finance, a testament to my dedication to being at the forefront of business acumen and financial expertise.
		<br>
		<br>

		My professional trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable, marked by roles that not only honed my skill set but also fueled my passion for technology and business development. In the bustling city of Burlingame, California, I joined Fanfare Entertainment very early into its founding, as a Product Manager, where I was at the helm of developing mobile applications for renowned celebrities and brands. I spearheaded the creation of the official mobile application for the globally acclaimed artist, Keith Urban, a venture that redefined fan engagement by integrating virtual currency, thereby pioneering new revenue streams and enhancing the brand’s global engagement.
		<br>
		<br>

		In my relentless quest to innovate, I founded Banwell Technologies, a platform that democratized mobile app creation, offering a springboard for budding entrepreneurs and businesses to bring their ideas to fruition. Leading a vibrant team of 30 professionals, we crafted a space that fostered innovation and collaboration, fostering partnerships with industry leaders and facilitating cross-promotion and collaborative opportunities.
		<br>
		<br>

		I further honed my venture capital prowess as the Managing Partner at Pioneer Venture Group in Denver, Colorado. Here, I orchestrated a portfolio of over 10 seed-stage investments, nurturing them to experience substantial growth and, soon sonme successful strategic exits. My role was pivotal in developing and sustaining relationships with founders, co-investors, and key stakeholders in the startup ecosystem, a network that would become the bedrock of lucrative deal opportunities.
		<br>
		<br>

		During my tenure at Techstars as an MBA Intern in Business Development and Financial Analysis, I immersed myself further in the vibrant world of startups, offering invaluable insights and facilitating key decisions through custom-built financial models. My efforts were instrumental in raising over $100,000, showcasing my adeptness in navigating the intricacies of venture capital fundraising.
		<br>
		<br>

		Parallel to my professional journey, I have also been an active participant in notable projects, like spearheading a strategic initiative at Maxar Technologies to identify potential M&A targets in various high-potential sectors, where I displayed an innate knack for recognizing synergies and evaluating integration challenges, presenting data-driven insights that significantly influenced Maxar's M&A strategy.
		<br>
		<br>

		Outside the boardroom, I've ventured into the fascinating realms of technology and gaming. An avid E-sports enthusiast, I was crowned a world champion in the VR Master League in December 2020. My curiosity has also led me to build my cryptocurrency, delving deep into the nuances of blockchain technology and hash functions. Currently, I'm weaving the realms of technology and pet care, working on an AI-powered toy to keep my feline friend entertained during my absence.
		<br>
		<br>

		Throughout my journey, I have been a recipient of several accolades that recognize my prowess and contributions to the business ecosystem. From being a finalist in various case competitions to being honored with the NASA Ames Scholarship in 2012, each recognition has been a stepping stone, motivating me to strive for greater heights.
		<br>
		<br>

		With certifications like CSRIC® and PCEP™ under my belt, and proficiency in languages such as Java, Python, and R, I am fully equipped to tackle the ever-evolving challenges of the business world. As I stand at this juncture, my journey is a reflection of passion, perseverance, and a constant pursuit of excellence, and I am eager to carve out newer paths and reach unprecedented milestones.
