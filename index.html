            <h2>Why Build a Website?</h2>
            <p>By building a website I believe I will be better able to keep track of, and update, any projects I am working on for reference by myself or others, as well as better educate myself on some of the technical aspects 
			required to run this site. This is a learning process for me, and I hope to use this as a tool to better delvelop my skills both professionally and personally. With that being said, I am glad that you are here - whether that is via a personal connection to me, or if it is because you are here via a career I have applied to.</p>
