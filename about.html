        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Alex Glasson, a serial entrepreneur, and a confluence of innovation 
            and strategic foresight, hoping to advance my career into the venture capital space. 
            My journey in the corporate world is a testimony to 
            relentless pursuit, visionary leadership, and an unwavering commitment to fostering growth 
            and innovation in the business ecosystem.
            <br>
            <br>
            I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I was immersed in the spirit of innovation from a very young age. Both of my parents worked 
            as computer engineers in the early days of Silicon Valley, my father joining Apple while it was still considered a "Start-Up,"
            and my mother eventually becoming one of the first female executives in the Valley. This upbringing instilled a certain foresight for technology
            that has stuck with me my entire life.
            In my opinion, the wheels of progress are constantly moving us forward, and whether or not you are on board, the train waits for no one.
            My first experience with this phenomena was in the 3rd grade where I vehemently argued with my teacher that math should be done using technology.
            I was met with the response "You won't always have a calculator in your pocket." Which, in hindsight seems ridiculous in our current world, 
            as almost all of us not only have a calculator in our pockets at all time, but have the entire wealth of human knowledge available to us within seconds.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout high school, I engaged thoroughly with my studies through the various AP classes that were available, and found a 
            love for statistics via a particularly engaging professor who helped to conceptualize the subject through the lens 
            of gambling. However, my true passions at the time were for skiing and musical theatre - the latter of which has 
            brought me lifelong skills in presenting and public speaking that I believe are un-teachable. 
            I would make the 4-5 hour trip every weekend with my dad up to Lake Tahoe, where I would either ski race, or train 
            for a future ski race - and let me tell you, I was good at it. I won races for years, often beating people 
            outside of my age range, and even occaisionally beating adults. I still hold a deep love and respect for the mountains to 
            this day.
            <br>
            <br>
            As high school ended, I, as well as all of my peers, turned our sights to College - as most American high school students do.
            I heard the echoes of generations past in my head - "Be a doctor. Be a lawyer. Be successful." So I applied to, and was accpeted 
            into the University of British Columbia's pre-med program for neuropsychology, considered by many to be the best university in Canada. 
            At the time, this was a dream come true, as I was both pursuing what I had been told was the pinnacle of status and success, 
            while still being able to ski at a world renowned ski resort like Whistler. Unfortunately those rose-colored glasses would not last, 
            and I would end up tearing my ACL 3 years into my studies. This made me reassess everything in my life, threatened with the possibility 
            of never being able to ski again shook me to my core. I realized that I had spent all of my time pursuing the dreams of others, and 
            was not content with where I ended up. I didn't have a passion for medicine, I was doing it because I was told that it would bring me happiness. 
            So, 3 years into my studies, and 20 credits short of graduation, I decided to drop out and find what would bring me meaning in life that was truly 
            my own. It was around this time, that I was given the offer to join Fanfare, which I did - in pursuit of the Silicon Valley dream that I had 
            been immersed in for so long. This ended up being the single greatest decision I have ever made. I was now fully in control of my future, and it felt 
            incredible.
            <br>
            <br>
            My professional trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable, marked by roles that not only honed my skill set but also 
            fueled my passion for technology and business development. In Burlingame, California, 
            I joined Fanfare Entertainment very early into its founding, as a Product Manager, where I was at the helm of 
            developing mobile applications for renowned celebrities and brands. I spearheaded the creation of the official mobile 
            application for the globally acclaimed artist, Keith Urban, a venture that redefined fan engagement by being one of the first 
            applications that fully integrated virtual currency, thereby pioneering new revenue streams and enhancing the brand's global engagement. 
            Fanfare is where I truly realized my passion for start-ups, entrepreneurship, and the zeal for innovative thinking. We went through multiple large-scale 
            pivots, beginning as a music production studio and platform that promised a full suite of services from recording, to mixing and 
            mastering, to distribution, all while keeping our fee structure lower than an artist would pay with ITunes. This is how we became 
            involved with Keith Urban and his people - our first large scale success. After building Keith Urban's app, we would go on to build 
            apps for artists like Bryan Adams, Heart, and even a comprehensive app for Nobu Matsuhisa Restaurants that included hotel and restaurant 
            reservations and a POS system. It would turn out that the backend software that we had been developing over the years would be almost 
            a perfect 1-to-1 analog for a healthcare systems application, so we pivoted once again, and I had to learn everything I possibly could 
            about HIPAA before we were acquired. 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            I re-embarked on my academic sojourn at the University of Denver, Daniels College of Business, 
            where I finally earned my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, 
            graduating with Cum Laude honors. Driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge, 
            I continued to broaden my horizons, where I am currently pursuing an MBA and an MS in Finance, 
            a testament to my dedication to being at the forefront of business acumen and financial expertise.
            <br>
            <br>
    
            In my relentless quest to innovate, I founded Banwell Technologies, a platform aimed at democratizing mobile app creation, 
            offering a springboard for budding entrepreneurs and businesses to bring their ideas to fruition. Leading a vibrant team 
            of 30 professionals, we crafted a space that fostered innovation and collaboration, fostering partnerships with industry 
            leaders and facilitating cross-promotion and collaborative opportunities.
            <br>
            <br>
    
            I further honed my venture capital prowess as the Managing Partner at Pioneer Venture Group in Denver, Colorado, where I currently work. 
            Here, I orchestrated a portfolio of over 10 seed-stage investments, nurturing them to experience substantial growth and, 
            soon, hopefully, some successful strategic exits. My role has been pivotal in developing and sustaining relationships with founders, 
            co-investors, and key stakeholders in the startup ecosystem, a network that has become the bedrock of lucrative deal 
            opportunities.
            <br>
            <br>
    
            During my tenure at Techstars as an MBA Intern in Business Development and Financial Analysis, 
            I immersed myself further in the vibrant world of startups, offering invaluable insights and facilitating key 
            decisions through custom-built financial models. My efforts were instrumental in raising over $100,000, 
            showcasing my adeptness in navigating the intricacies of venture capital fundraising.
            <br>
            <br>
    
            Parallel to my professional journey, I have also been an active participant in notable projects, 
            like spearheading a strategic initiative at Maxar Technologies to identify potential M&A targets in 
            various high-potential sectors, where I displayed an innate knack for recognizing synergies and evaluating 
            integration challenges, presenting data-driven insights that significantly influenced Maxar's M&A strategy.
            <br>
            <br>
    
            Outside the boardroom, I've ventured into the fascinating realms of technology and gaming. An avid E-sports 
            enthusiast, I was crowned a world champion in the VR Master League in December 2020. My curiosity has also 
            led me to build my own cryptocurrency, delving deep into the nuances of blockchain technology and hash functions. 
            Currently, I'm weaving the realms of technology and pet care, working on an AI-powered toy to keep my feline friend 
            entertained while I'm not at home.
            <br>
            <br>
    
            Throughout my journey, I have been a recipient of several accolades that recognize my prowess and 
            contributions to the business ecosystem. From being a winner in various case competitions to 
            being honored with the NASA Ames Scholarship in 2012, each recognition has been a stepping stone, 
            motivating me to strive for greater heights.
            <br>
            <br>
    
            With certifications like CSRIC® and PCEP™ under my belt, and proficiency in languages such as Java, Python, and R, 
            I am fully equipped to tackle the ever-evolving challenges of the business world. As I stand at this juncture, 
            my journey is a reflection of passion, perseverance, and a constant pursuit of excellence, and I am eager to 
            carve out newer paths and reach unprecedented milestones.
